        "Our approach to data migration allows you to focus on your business needs, while we do the heavy lifting of building a pipeline for your data. The technical solution we leverage is scalable, secure, and allows us to build your integration quickly with little-to-no ongoing cost. We start by learning about the data you need migrated and how you plan to use this data in Salesforce. This informs data mapping and business rules, which are then used to build the integration. At the core of our process is quality. Our testing approach includes validating not only the code, but also user profiles and Salesforce configurations. And, of course, we make sure you give the final seal of approval through User Acceptance Testing (UAT).",
